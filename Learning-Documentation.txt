# Learning-Documentation: July 10th Class Work on Computer Architecture



The CPU Visual Simulator can be accessed at https://cpuvisualsimulator.github.io.


Summary of Content:

The CPU Visual Simulator is an excellent teaching tool that gives us a thorough understanding of how a CPU functions. It provides you with a visual depiction of the internal processes of the CPU. You can enter code and observe the CPU's step-by-step processing of it.


Key Takeaways:

It Demonstrates the interactions between the various CPU components when executing commands.
Let's input the assembly instructions and observe the changes in the CPU's state.
Excellent for teaching assembly language and CPU architecture.


Personal Insights or Reflections:

The visual method greatly simplifies the understanding of complex CPU operations.
It's a fantastic tool for computer science instructors and students.


Feedback and Reflection:

The interface is straightforward and easy to use, but more tutorials or guides would be nice.
Adding advanced features or real-world CPU models could make it even better.
Being able to save and share simulations would be super helpful for group projects.

Summary of Content:

Godbolt Compiler Explorer is a web tool that lets you see the output of different compilers. You can write code in various programming languages and see the assembly code generated by other compilers. It’s great for understanding how high-level code gets translated into machine code.


Key Takeaways:

Supports many programming languages like C++, Rust, Go, and more.
Lets you choose different compilers and see how the assembly code changes.
Gives real-time feedback and a detailed view of the compilation process.


Personal Insights or Reflections:

Seeing the assembly code helps you write more efficient and optimized code.
It’s super useful for debugging and optimizing code, especially for performance-heavy applications.
Provides a hands-on way to learn about how compilers work and how high-level code is turned into machine instructions.


Feedback and Reflection:

The interface is user-friendly and easy to understand, but more documentation or tutorials would help.
Comparing the outputs of multiple compilers side-by-side is a really powerful feature.

It seems easy but since I am personally not a big Progamming guy it kinda seems tricky to me but I am hopfull that if I continue to earn it I will be able to learn it well enough.
