# Learning-Documentation
So here I will be documenting the steps involved for this particular assignment:
I started with the links provided and searched them up and tried to understand them. Then I took help from google to understand more about the simulation and continued with the given links.
After that, I followed the Assignment rubrics and then learnt how to set up Github.
Then I made a github repository wih all the desired specs, (having a README file for documentaion, making it public) etc.
After learning my way around how github works, I started compliling everything on this repository named: Learning-Documentation.
Then we have to do a reflection which I Included in my file.
Overall, I think the most amount of time was taken to understand the links and finding out my way through github. But all in all it was a wonderful experience.
